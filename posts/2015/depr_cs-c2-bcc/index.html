<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p><strong>Info:</strong></p>
<p>Updated: 10/16/2015
Total Words: About 2243</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The title of this chapter is <em>Basic Computer Concepts</em>, so we can get the main idea from it. It's about some terms and concepts of computer that we must know about, because these are most fundamental knowledge of the device we use a lot in our modern life.</p>
<p>The key terms will be set as italic type, and they will be bold so we can find them easily.</p>
<p>Some description of the term from the book, other from my own words or Wikipedia.</p>
<h3 id="key-terminology-and-concepts">Key Terminology and Concepts</h3>
<h4 id="classification-of-computers">Classification of Computers</h4>
<p>From this subtitle, we could know about the main content of this section. It's about the different kinds of computers we have seen or not.</p>
<h5 id="basic-terms">Basic terms</h5>
<p><em>computer</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.</p>
<p>Before we learn the terms of <em>computer</em>, we should know what is a <em>computer</em>. The computers have been used everywhere, we could's live without them. They stand for the high-technology. They make our life colorful and easy.</p>
<p><em>device</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A tool we use to produce something.</p>
<p>In computer science, we consider any parts of hardware components are all <em>devices</em>.</p>
<p><em>terminal</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A kind of equipment in computer field, that usually consisting of a keyboard (input device) and a screen (output device) that joins the user to a central computer system (like mainframe).</p>
<p>But if a <em>terminal</em> is nothing more than a screen and keyboard, it's called <em>dumb terminal</em>.</p>
<h5 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h5>
<p><em><strong>personal computer</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A general-purpose computer whose size, capabilities and original sale price make it useful for individuals, and is intended to be operated directly by an end-user with no intervening computer operator.</p>
<p>A <em>personal computer</em> could only be used by one person at one time. It's the difference from some other kinds of computer (like mainframe, minicomputer). The related term PC is usually means the Wintel platform now.</p>
<p><em><strong>laptop</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A portable personal computer with all the devices inside a single so that is suitable for mobile use.</p>
<p><em>Laptop</em> is a kind of personal computer, but it's light and small because it contains all the devices inside a single, so it's easy to carry everywhere in our daily life. This term is same to <em>notebook</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>workstation</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A set of computers that connected together to share data with the network.</p>
<p>The company often use the <em>workstation</em>, because it's convenient to share the customers&rsquo; data with the Local Area Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>mainframe</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A powerful computer that is shared by multiple users, each user has a terminal that could work separately.</p>
<p><em>Mainframes</em> often used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning and transaction processing.</p>
<p><em><strong>minicomputer</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A smaller computer that is used by multiple users, but its price and capabilty is lower than a mainframe.</p>
<p>Minicomputers are developed in the mid-1960s, they are becoming history.</p>
<p><em><strong>supercomputer</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A computer with a high-level computational capacity compared to a general-purpose computer.</p>
<p>China does well in this field, we have Tianhe-1A, Tianhe-2 that are famous around the world for the fastest computational capability.</p>
<p><em><strong>server</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A kind of computer that is on a network to provide a service to other computer which is in its LAN.</p>
<p>A mainframe, even a personal computer is enough powerful to be a <em>server</em>. A server often provide network or data service for the other computer.</p>
<p><em><strong>client</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A computer that uses a server for some remote service.</p>
<p>A <em>client</em> could send requirements to the remote service, so we don't need set the <em>client</em> and server nearly. It could work by the special network or telephone lines.</p>
<h4 id="binary">Binary</h4>
<p>Numeral system has different kinds. Such as decimal system, binary system, octal system, hexadecimal system and so on. Each of them has different uses.</p>
<h5 id="binary-basics">Binary Basics</h5>
<p><em><strong>binary</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>off</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
0(in binary)</p>
<p><em><strong>on</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
1(in binary)</p>
<h5 id="binary-in-computer-science">Binary in Computer Science</h5>
<p><em><strong>bit</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A <em>bit</em> is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.</p>
<p>It's come from the term <em>binary digit</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>byte</strong></em></p>

The <em>byte</em> is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.</p>
<p><em><strong>character</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
A character is a unit of information that is any letter, digit or other symble that can displayed by typing on a keyboard.</p>
<p>Different programming languages have different sizes of character. In Java, one character is equal to 16 bits or 2 bytes. But in C/C++, one character is equal to 8 bits or 1 bytes.</p>
<h5 id="digtal-versus-analog">Digtal Versus Analog</h5>

<em>Sampling</em> means taking analog measurements at intervals and then quantizing each measurements.</p>
<p>We often use this term in music field. The audio is sampled many times per second. (Capture the entire original signal, then turn into numbers.)</p>
<p><em><strong>sample rate</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:
<em>Sample rate</em> is the number of samples taken per second.</p>
<p><em><strong>bits per sample</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:

<h5 id="power-of-2">Power of 2</h5>
<p>A <em>power of two</em> means a number of the form 2^n where n is an integer in computer science. So computers are described as a number like 256, or 512.</p>
<h5 id="size-terminology">Size Terminology</h5>
<p>General value:</p>
<p><em><strong>1 gigahertz</strong></em> = <em><strong>1,000 megabits</strong></em> = <em><strong>1,000,000 kilobytes</strong></em></p>
